# Saturday Hack Night Dialogflow

You are looking at this repo, this could mean one of two things.
  1. You Are A Participant
  2. You Are too curious to see what others have built
 
Here I will address the first group, if you came to explore feel free to look around!

## Getting Started

Since you are here I assume you have registered for this hack night, if not get yourself registered [here](http://tinkerhub.org/saturday-hack-night/). 

To participate in this Hacknight all you have to do is build something cool using DialogFlow API. Here are some ideas to get your creativity flowing,

 - **Word Calculator** - This is not any ordinary calculator but one which can speak human language. The basic idea is `one + one = two` . But you can go on and make something like `10 Men + 11 Women = 10 Couples and 1 Freebird`. 
 - **Mood Meme** - This is a meme generator that automatically generates memes based on the mood of the text entered by the user. You can do just a simple text overlay on pre-saved images or go crazy and generate something custom.
 - **Emoji Keyboard** - This is the easiest to explain but the hardest to build ( or is it !? ). In short, something that can convert `2Ô∏è‚É£üê¶üå≥` to `Two Birds on a Tree`

## Submitting Your Creations

You all must be used to submitting something after you are done building, but here it is the other way around ( twist... twist ! ).

Here is what to do,

### Step 1
**Fork this repo** This shouldn't need any more explanation but still, you should fork this repo ( use the button above ) to your repository. This should be done by the team-lead and make sure to use the registered GitHub id when forking.

### Step 2 
**Create A Folder** You should create a folder at the root of the forked repo (  preferably on the main branch ). The folder name should be you ***Team ID*** and all your work should be done in it only. Any files created outside this folder will be deleted before evaluation.

### Step 3
**Draft a Pull Request** As soon as you create your folder create a draft pull request to this repo. The title of the PR must be in the format `Team ID | Project Name`. Give us a short description of what you are going to do by filling the pull request template.

### Step 4
**Start Codding** Finally! You can start making your dream project. At this point, our team will be monitoring your progress and giving you timely updates. Try to commit code frequently so that we can get back to you in case of any error.
